1. as/so ... as ...
结构︰as／so＋形容词或副词原级＋as…
说明︰此句型意为“…和…一样…”。比较两件东西，并表示它们的程度一样。第一个 as 为<副词>，第二个 as 则为<副词><连接词>，引导<副词子句>，修饰第一个 as。在 as…as 中可插入单数<可数名词>，即：“as＋<形容词>＋a／an＋<名词>＋as”。若是复数<名词>，可用“as many／few＋复数 <名词>＋as”；若是<不可数名词>，则用“as much／little＋<不可数名词>＋as”。“as＋原级（形、副）＋as＋原级（形、副）”这形式表示有关同一人（物）的两种不同的性质、状态是一样程度的，译作“既有…且还有…”。
